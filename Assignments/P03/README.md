## P03 - Image Ascii Art
### Calvin Walmer
### Description:

This program serves to demonstrate how packages are used in go. By creating a repo on github and
making it accessible to the public, packages that are in the repo can be added into go projects. I
have created a package called img_mod that contains useful functions for converting an image to ascii art.
This project uses the repo and it can be found here: https://github.com/CalvinWalmer/img_mod
